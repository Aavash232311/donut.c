# Spinning Donut Project

A simple 3D donut (torus) animation project I built a year ago, which I later rewrote in C to deepen my understanding of low-level programming and math. The project uses the torus’s parametric equations to generate its 3D coordinates and rotates it in real time by combining transformations along the X and Z axes. The goal was to practice **matrix transformations, 3D geometry, and rendering in a text-based or simple graphical environment**.

## Key Concepts and Skills Gained

- Parametric equations for 3D shapes
- Rotation using X- and Z-axis transformation matrices
- Low-level implementation in C
- Understanding 3D coordinate mapping and projection
- Real-time animation logic
